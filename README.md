# vit-comp

Heyy, you can find some of my notes/backup and all the other stuff I do/did over the years in VIT. 

> Since this is my personal backup entry, it wont be much organized at every point.

### clone & pull 

Heyy, so if you are a new person on the repo, you can use `git clone` <br />
but, if you already have  `vit-comp` on your system, <b />
you can use the command `git pull` instead of cloning it again on `vit-comp/` folder to get the updates.
<br />

Anyway, feel free to roam around :)
